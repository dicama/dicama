### How to contribute
We are a group of curious thinkers and makers with the goal to build an open-source ecosystem for cancer management. Our framework is designed to be community-driven and modular. Therefore, we provide templating for coders and non-coders alike. Be part by contributing modules to our DiCaMa Application MONK. To make it easy for you to start right away, use our lowcode scripting language (for reference see <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules">Monk Modules</a>). 

> Check our <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.MD">Contribution Guidelines</a> to get you started :rocket:
> 

Our guidelines should assure seamless and qualitative integration for your future contributions to the MONK ecosystem.

### The MONK App Ecosystem
Our modular framework aims to provide modularity and openness for developments, while at the same time ensuring data sovereignty for users. Contributions thereby may include but are not limited to the integration of 3rd-party modules to the <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules">MONK Modulestore</a> (via PRs),
developments for our <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-app">MONK-App</a> and involved packages (via PRs),
bug fixing, community work by filing issues either for <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-app/issues">MONK-App</a>/<a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules/issues">MONK-Modules</a> or providing valuable feedback in any sense. 

#### Contributing with MONK-modules:

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=dicama&repo=monk-modules)](https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules)

Before starting to `#hackaway` with your module, we recommend to get in touch with our MONK audit team first either by filing an issue on
<a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules/issues">MONK-Modules</a> or via mail. Thereby, we know what you are up to
and could provide you valuable first feedback from our expert community as well as potential users. 

The following figure highlights our core-workflow to integrate your contribution within the MONK-Modulestore

## Contributing to the MONK Ecosystem-App

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=dicama&repo=monk-app)](https://github.com/dicama/monk-app)

We are looking forward to see any contribution to the MONK ecosystem App via PRs. As the integral part of our modular framework is located within the development of the MONK App, we recommend contributors to contact our technical core team beforehand any major developments. This should ensure the integrity and consistance of the work, since you may need to get familiar with our current technical roadmap and processes involved (i.e. tree hygiene) to avoid common pitfalls. Getting in touch early on might be also an opportunity for us to involve you within the team and build a direct communication pipeline from the get-go. Nevertheless, we always try our best to keep you up-to-date about our future pipelines and roadmaps on GitHub. A high-level overview of our current `àpp-workflow`,`app-tree` and `layer-structure` is given in the follwing figure

### Why MONK?
Cancer is a f#*king complex issue (!)…. and dealing with it confronts every single patient with a variety of problems. 
For technical enthusiasts using their skills to solve these kinds of problems for patients can be a fun and purposeful activity.

To make helping patients for developers easy and as patient managing your cancer suck less, we came up with a modular open-source framework called MONK – which is an German
abbreviation and stands for “Meine Onkologie” (my oncology) or technically speaking for “Modulare Onkologie” (modular onkology). As greater picture we envision a disease
management operating system – basically something like Linux just for Cancer and later for all kind of diseases.

Open-Source is powerful and runs the world. But for us it is more than just being able to use and share code freely, it is about caring, human connections and for the sake of
community. So, we challenge ourselves not only with coding for purpose and excellence, but to become the best community possible.

The origin of this project is within a small non-profit tech community called Health Hacker e.V. from Germany. Our first rule there will be adapted for the Monk community as
well: “Be excellent to each other”. But also, our approach to involve patients as much and as soon as possible. This project would not exist without the wonderful
“Krebskriegerin” and it is great to know the people behind the screens from the brainstorming, feedback and discussion. Of course, achieving this in virtual community will be a
bit tricky, but we trust in the kindness and curiosity of all of you.

Enough of declaration and pathos, now enjoy `#hacking` away with us!

Cheers
Your Monk Team
