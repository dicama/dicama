### How to contribute
We are a group of curious thinkers and makers with the goal to build an open-source ecosystem for cancer management. Our framework is designed to be community-driven and modular. Therefore, we provide templating for coders and non-coders alike. Be part by contributing modules to our DiCaMa Application MONK. To make it easy for you to start right away, use our lowcode scripting language (for reference see <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules">Monk Modules</a>). 

> Check our <a href="https://github.com/dicama/monk-modules/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.MD">Contribution Guidelines</a> to get you started :rocket:
> 

Our guidelines should assure seamless and qualitative integration for your future contributions to the MONK ecosystem.

### The MONK App Ecosystem
Our modular framework aims to provide modularity and openness for developments, while at the same time ensuring data sovereignty for users. Contributions thereby may include but
are not limited to the integration of 3rd-party modules to the MONK Modulestore (via PRs), developments for our MONK-App and involved packages (via PRs), bug fixing, beeing an
excellent community member and help filing issues either for MONK-App/MONK-Modules or providing valuable feedback in any sense. The following figure highlights our core-workflow
to integrate your contribution within the MONK-Modulestore.

`Access authorizations` in MONK: Data is only stored locally on the device and encrypted accordingly. Additionally, users have the option to secure the apps functional interface
via system lock (e.g. by using their respective system-pin or fingerprint). For subsequent backup solutions, the patient should use the private key to secure all data or
transfer it to other devices. To ensure modularity and data sovereignty, there is a central access layer that clearly defines access authorizations for all modules. Hereby,
users should be informed about access-streams to their data, give consent and have the possibility to adjust access rights accordingly.  This is done either when a new module is
started or by using the privacy view within the application.

In order for an informed decision to be made by both, the intended MONK audit team in the review process and later by the patient him/herself, developers who access data from
other modules must provide a reason for doing so. As part of a quality control by the audit team before admission to the internal module store, both technical and medical
aspects should be reviewed and evaluated.

### Why MONK?
Cancer is a f#*king complex issue (!)…. and dealing with it confronts every single patient with a variety of problems. 
For technical enthusiasts using their skills to solve these kinds of problems for patients can be a fun and purposeful activity.

To make helping patients for developers easy and as patient managing your cancer suck less, we came up with a modular open-source framework called Monk – which is an German
abbreviation and stands for “Meine Onkologie” (my oncology) or technically speaking for “Modulare Onkologie” (modular onkology). As greater picture we envision a disease
management operating system – basically something like Linux just for Cancer and later for all kind of diseases.

Open-Source is powerful and runs the world. But for us it is more than just being able to use and share code freely, it is about caring, human connections and for the sake of
community. So, we challenge ourselves not only with coding for purpose and excellence, but to become the best community possible.

The origin of this project is within a small non-profit tech community called Health Hacker e.V. from Germany. Our first rule there will be adapted for the Monk community as
well: “Be excellent to each other”. But also, our approach to involve patients as much and as soon as possible. This project would not exist without the wonderful
“Krebskriegerin” and it is great to know the people behind the screens from the brainstorming, feedback and discussion. Of course, achieving this in virtual community will be a
bit tricky, but we trust in the kindness and curiosity of all of you.

Enough of declaration and pathos, now enjoy `#hacking` away with us!

Cheers
Your Monk Team
